action_manager:
  remove_character:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__remove_character"
    enabled: true
    description: |

  travel:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__travel"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      Move the player to an existing location. This is the most comprehensive tool -
      it combines travel, narration, action suggestions, AND chat summary into a single call.

      When you use this tool:
      1. The chat summary is saved to world history (what happened at the current location)
      2. The player is moved to the destination
      3. Your narration is displayed to the player (like the 'narration' tool)
      4. Your action suggestions appear as clickable buttons (like 'suggest_options')

      **REQUIRED Parameters:**
      - destination: Location name to travel to (should already exist)
      - user_action: The player's original action that triggered this travel (e.g., "Go to the tavern"). Provides continuity for the next scene.
      - chat_summary: A 2-4 sentence summary of what happened at the current location before leaving. Focus on key events, decisions, and outcomes. This is saved to the world's history.md file.
      - narration: The narrative text describing the journey and arrival.  Make it vivid and engaging, describing what the player experiences.
      - action_1: First suggested action at the new location
      - action_2: Second suggested action at the new location

      **Optional Parameters:**
      - bring_characters: List of NPC names to bring along

      Use Task tool with location_designer to create new locations before traveling there.

      {travel_result}

  inject_memory:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__inject_memory"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      Inject a memory into a specific character's recent_events.
      Use this when external events should implant memories into NPCs, such as hypnosis, mind control, illusions, or similar supernatural effects.
      The character will remember this as if it actually happened or regard as commonsense.
    response: |
      {inject_memory_result}

  move_character:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__move_character"
    enabled: true

      **Probability Distribution:**
      - very_lucky (1%): Exceptional success, bonus rewards

      **Usage:**
      Call this tool when the player attempts something risky or uncertain.

  narration:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__narration"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      REQUIRED: Create a visible narrative message describing the outcome of the player's action.

      This is the text the player will see in the chat. It should be:
      - Vivid and engaging with sensory details
      - Appropriate to the world's genre and tone
      - Focused on the outcome of their action
      - Natural continuation of the story

      **Writing Guidelines:**
      - Use present tense for immediacy
      - Engage multiple senses (sight, sound, smell)
      - Show NPC emotions through actions and dialogue
      - Keep paragraphs focused and punchy
      - End on a moment of tension or choice

      **DO NOT:**
      - Write the player's actions or feelings
      - Use purple prose or overwrite
      - Resolve situations too quickly

      Call this AFTER resolving mechanics (stat changes via change_stat, travel, etc.) to describe what happened.
    response: |
      ✓ Narrative message created and displayed to player.

  suggest_options:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__suggest_options"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      REQUIRED: Provide two suggested actions for the player at the end of your turn.
      These suggestions appear as clickable buttons in the UI.

      Good suggestions:
      - Are contextually relevant to the current situation
      - Offer meaningful choices (not just "go left" / "go right")
      - Can include dialogue options, actions, or exploration
      - Should feel natural given what just happened
    response: |
      **Suggested Actions:**
      1. {action_1}
      2. {action_2}

  change_stat:
    name: "mcp__action_manager__change_stat"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      Apply stat and inventory changes to player state.
      Used directly by Action Manager after determining mechanical effects.
      Persists changes to filesystem and syncs to database.

      **Parameters:**
      - summary: Brief explanation of what happened mechanically
      - stat_changes: List of {{stat_name, delta}} objects for stat modifications
      - inventory_changes: List of {{action, item_id, name, quantity}} for inventory

      **IMPORTANT: Item Handling**
      - Items can ONLY be added if they already exist in the world's items/ directory.
      - Use Task with item_designer to create new items BEFORE adding to inventory.
      - If an item doesn't exist, it will be SKIPPED and reported in the response.
      - Removing items always works (no template required).

      **Note:** For time advancement, use `advance_time` tool separately.
    response: |
      {persist_result}

  advance_time:

      **Parameters:**
      - minutes: Amount of time to advance (required, minimum 1)
