      Create a lightweight world draft with genre, theme, and lore summary.

      create thematically consistent content while you refine the full lore.

      **Parameters:**
      - genre: World genre (e.g., 'dark fantasy', 'sci-fi horror')
      - theme: Thematic elements (e.g., 'survival and redemption')
      - lore_summary: One-paragraph summary (50-1000 chars)
    response: |
      World draft created.
      Genre: {genre}
      Theme: {theme}
      Sub-agents can now start with this context.

    name: "mcp__onboarding__persist_world"
    enabled: true
    description: |
      Persist comprehensive world data: full lore + stat system + player state.
      Call this AFTER sub-agents have started with draft_world context.
      Overwrites the draft lore with the full version.

      **Parameters:**
      - lore: Comprehensive world lore (8-15 paragraphs)
      - stat_system: The stat system (4-6 stats)
      - initial_stats: Optional stat overrides
      - world_notes: Optional notes for other agents

      2. Sub-agents (location_designer, character_designer, item_designer)
      3. persist_world (full lore, stats)

      **Parameters:**
      - player_name: The name the player wants to be called
    response: |
      World initialized successfully.
      Player: {player_name}
      Phase: active

      The world is now ready for adventure!
