"""
Single Writer Pattern for SQLite.

This module provides a centralized write queue that serializes all database
writes through a single background task. This eliminates SQLite write contention
when multiple concurrent operations try to write simultaneously.

Usage:
    from infrastructure.database.write_queue import enqueue_write, start_writer, stop_writer

    # At app startup
    await start_writer()

    # For writes
    result = await enqueue_write(my_write_coroutine())

    # At app shutdown
    await stop_writer()
