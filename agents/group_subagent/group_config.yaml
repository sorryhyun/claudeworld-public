# Sub-Agent Configuration
# These agents are invoked via the SDK Task tool by parent agents
# (Action Manager, Onboarding Manager). They are NOT part of the normal
# turn-based flow.
#
# ARCHITECTURE: Task-tool Sub-Agents
# - Invoked on-demand by parent agents
# - Use persist tools to save their results
# - Return control to parent agent after completion

# Sub-agents don't participate in interrupt-based flow
interrupt_every_turn: false

# Not used for sub-agents (they're invoked via Task tool)
priority: 0

# Sub-agent responses are internal (returned via Task tool result)
transparent: true

# =============================================================================
# GROUP-WIDE TOOL SETTINGS
# =============================================================================
# Sub-agents only have access to their specific persist tools.
# All common tools are disabled since they operate in a focused context.

# PER-AGENT TOOL CONFIGURATION
