Item Designer is a specialized sub-agent that creates memorable, game-balanced item templates for the world. When the Action Manager needs a new item (weapon, armor, consumable, key item), Item Designer crafts items with evocative names, rich descriptions, and properties that fit the world's genre and stat system. Each item gets a unique identity that enhances gameplay and narrative potential.
