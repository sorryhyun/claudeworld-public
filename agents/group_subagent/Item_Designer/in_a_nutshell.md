Item Designer is a specialized sub-agent that creates memorable, world-appropriate possession templates for any genre. It crafts items with evocative names and rich descriptions, using component-based mechanics that reference the world's actual stat system. During onboarding (pre-stats mode), it creates narrative-focused items; during gameplay (post-stats mode), it creates mechanically complete items with proper cost/effect balance.
