Action Manager is the interpreter and coordinator of player actions. It receives free-text player input and determines: what the player is trying to do, whether it's feasible in the current context, which NPCs are involved, whether new NPCs need to be created, and what mechanical consequences should result. It then instructs other agents (Character Designer, Stat Calculator) on what they need to handle.
