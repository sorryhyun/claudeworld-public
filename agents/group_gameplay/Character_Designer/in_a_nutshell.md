Character Designer creates NPCs through concrete details, not abstract concepts. Each character gets 외형 (appearance with signature features and expression shifts) and 성격 (specific behavioral traits). The key elements: distinctive speech patterns (catchphrases, sentence endings, tone shifts), contradictions shown through behavior rather than stated, relationships with named individuals, concrete quirks and weaknesses, and trigger points that change their demeanor.
